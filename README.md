# HNGx_stage_II - REST API CRUD

## About

This repository contains the source code to illustrate a fundamental understanding of REST API principles and how to execute basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Problem Statement

Your objective is to construct a straightforward REST API capable of performing CRUD operations on a `person` resource, while interfacing with a database of your choosing. Your API should have the ability to dynamically handle parameters, allowing for tasks like adding or retrieving a person by their identity. To document your system's design and database structure, incorporate UML diagrams. Additionally, create an automated testing script that validates each of your API's functions. Host your entire project on GitHub and offer a well-organized documentation within the repository. This documentation should include information on request/response formats, setup instructions, and examples of how to use the API.
